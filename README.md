# DynamicRelationship
STAT642(Time series and dynamic models) Course project. Modeling on dynamic international relationship using extended latent space model.

### Report and Slides

Inside the folder report_slides_paper

### Real Data Analysis

Inside the folder realdataanalysis.

*.R includes the codes 
- whether hold out the last matrix as missing values (mis/nomis)
- whether include shrinkage prior enable learning the dimension of latent space (tau)

*.RData realdataset 

*.txt file include different parameter setting and corresponding sensitivity analysis.

*.Rmd include the posterior inference and visualization.


### Sanity check

Check the performance of proposed model is the true generating process is latent model evolving via AR process as we assume.

Provide ideas on how to set the hyperparameters.

### Simulation on product of AR process

Validate the properties of product of AR process.

Provide ideas on parameter setting.
